## Assembly Issues

- **3U Extension Mounts:** The small rectangular joints initially used to mount the 3u extension were not strong enough. I opted for a long brace connection instead for better stability.

- **Faulty RAM Stick:** One stick of RAM was not functional and did not appear in the BIOS. This required a full disassembly of the PC to swap out the faulty stick.

- **Warped 5U Posts:** The original 5U posts were warped due to the ambient temperature in the room being too cold during printing. I reprinted the posts to resolve the issue.
