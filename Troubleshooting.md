## Assembly Issues

- **3U Extension Mounts:** The small rectangular joints initially used to mount the 3u extension were not strong enough. I opted for a long brace connection instead for better stability.

- **Faulty RAM Stick:** One stick of RAM was not functional and did not appear in the BIOS. This required a full disassembly of the PC to swap out the faulty stick.

- **Warped 5U Posts:** The original 5U posts were warped due to the ambient temperature in the room being too cold during printing. I reprinted the posts to resolve the issue.

- **Incorrect buttons** The buttons originally purchased on Amazon had stated they were goo for PC assembly. This was not the case as they were self locking (Attempted anyway due to explicitly saying in the description) This meant a resolder of new buttons was needed. This was admittedly an oversight for me! All part of learning however.
