# 01 - Hardware Assembly

## Goal

This guide details the physical assembly of all server components into the custom 3D printed 10-inch rack-mount chassis.

## Tools Used

*   Electric screwdriver
*   Interchangeable screwdriver
*   Soldering iron (for melting in brass inserts)
*   3D printer
*   Calipers
*   Ruler
*   Sketch pad
*   Mechanical pencil

## Assembly Steps

### Step 0: Planning & Printing

It is important to plan the layout of your server before you start building. A quick sketch can help you visualize where each component will go and ensure that you have enough space for everything.

*Photo Placeholder: Show a photo of the rough plan sketched on a pad with tray positions in the case.*

1.  **Print all the pieces for the chassis.**

    *Photo Placeholder: Show a photo of all the printed pieces.*

### Step 1: Brass Inserts

1.  **Install the brass inserts.** This is a crucial step to ensure that all components can be securely mounted. Use a soldering iron to carefully heat and press the brass inserts into the posts, braces, ITX mount, and NAS case.

    *   **ITX Mount:** Uses M3 x 5.7 mm brass inserts and M3 x 6mm bolts.
    *   **NAS Case:** Uses M6 Brass Inserts (8mm OD, 4mm Length) and M6 x 10mm screws.

    *Photo Placeholder: Show a close-up of the different brass inserts.*

    *Photo Placeholder: Show the ITX mount and NAS case with inserts installed.*

### Step 2: Main Chassis Assembly

1.  **Attach the fan to the top of the case.** This should be configured to exhaust hot air out of the top of the chassis to ensure good airflow.

    *Photo Placeholder: Show the fan attached to the top panel.*

2.  **Assemble the bottom of the chassis.** Screw the frame together and add the feet.

    *Photo Placeholder: Show the assembled bottom frame with feet.*

3.  **Attach the posts to the bottom of the case.**

    *Photo Placeholder: Show the posts being fixed to the bottom of the case.*

4.  **Connect the long joints together.**

    *Photo Placeholder: Show the long joints being connected.*

### Step 3: Component Installation

1.  **Assemble the motherboard.** Install the CPU, RAM, and CPU cooler onto the motherboard.

    *Photo Placeholder: Show the motherboard with CPU, RAM, and cooler installed.*

2.  **Attach the motherboard to the ITX mount.** Also, install any PCIE expansion cards at this time.

    *Photo Placeholder: Show the final motherboard assembly on the ITX mount.*

3.  **Perform an initial boot test (POST).** Connect the PSU to the essential components (motherboard, CPU, one stick of RAM) and ensure the system boots into the BIOS.

    *Photo Placeholder: Show a picture of the BIOS screen during the initial POST.*

4.  **Insert the PSU into its bracket.**

    *Photo Placeholder: Show the PSU in its bracket.*

5.  **Assemble the NAS.** Assemble the NAS frame, connect the quick-swap cables, and fit the drives into the drive mounts.

    *Photo Placeholder: Show the assembled NAS frame and the drives in their mounts.*

### Step 4: Final Assembly

1.  **Start filling in the trays.** Install the ITX tray, NAS tray, and any other trays into the chassis. Rearrange if needed.
    > **Tip:** For heavy trays, print brackets long enough to reach both sides so they can be screwed in at the back for extra support.

    *Photo Placeholder: Show the trays being inserted into the chassis.*

2.  **Connect all the cables.** Connect the power cables for the NAS and PC, as well as any other components that need power or data.

    *Photo Placeholder: Show some of the cable connections.*

3.  **Attach the top panel.** Once all components are installed and connected, attach the top panel to complete the assembly.

    *Photo Placeholder: Show the finished, fully assembled server.*

## Conclusion

The assembly is complete. However, some parts were not printed to an amazing standard due to incorrect temperature settings or poor-quality filament. I plan to reprint these parts to improve the overall build quality. This is also noted in the troubleshooting log.
