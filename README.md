# HomelabRYZEN
This project details the design, assembly, and software configuration of a custom-built 10-inch homelab server. Powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 5700G processor and running Proxmox VE, this server is engineered to be a versatile platform for network-attached storage (NAS) using OpenMediaVault, a powerful media server with Plex, a flexible learning and development environment, and future-proofed for dedicated game server hosting.

The primary goal is to create a robust, energy-efficient, and easily expandable home server while simultaneously serving as a comprehensive portfolio piece demonstrating skills in hardware selection, system integration, virtualization, networking, and service deployment.
